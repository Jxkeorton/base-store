## Project Overview

 This application is an e-commerce application aimed to be simple and easy to navigate. The store aims to bring manufacturing to the UK to eradicate import costs. 

## User Experience (UX)

#### Client Goals

- Allow a secure payment method that users are familiar with
- Provide a backend to make it simple to add new products from different catorgories
- The site must be responsive to different devices
- A 'cart' area to allow the user to keep track of items added to the cart
  
## Design

### Colours used

- The chosen colors were picked to provide a visually appealing and coherent aesthetic throughout the website. The primary color used is #f02d34, which is a vibrant red tone used for important elements such as buttons and highlights. This color choice adds energy and attracts attention to key areas of the interface. 

- Secondary colors include various shades of gray (#324d67 and #ebebeb) for text and background elements, providing contrast and ensuring readability. These neutral tones complement the primary red color and create a balanced visual hierarchy.

### Typography

- **Primary Font:** The primary font used throughout the website is a system font stack that prioritizes readability and compatibility across different devices and platforms. The font stack includes popular sans-serif typefaces such as -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, Segoe UI, Roboto, and more.

- **Secondary Font:** Additionally, the website utilizes a custom font named 'hypik' for specific branding or decorative purposes. This font adds personality and uniqueness to certain headings or elements, enhancing the overall visual identity of the website.
